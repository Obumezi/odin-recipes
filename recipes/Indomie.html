    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Pour 2 glasses of water into a clean pot and leave to simmer on medium flame.</li>
        <li>Add spices (in the Ramen packet), add mixed vegetables with chopped pepper and onions and allow to boil for
            1 minute. Make sure the Pot is covered from the beginning.</li>
        <li>Now break the Noodles and pour into the boiling water with all those ingredients already in. Distribute it
            evenly around the pot then cover. Leave to cook for 5 minutes while occasionally stirring it so the heat
            goes around.</li>
        <li>Just before it is done, add the Sausages (you want them semi cooked so they can retain a little grit).</li>
        <li> Once it's cooked and the tenderess is to your liking, serve hot together with your Chicken or Eggs on the
            plate.</li>
    </ol>
